HOW-TO BUILD:
=============

**This short guide assumes you're on Ubuntu 11.04**

Getting the (right) source
--------------------------

First, we need to create directories for the build:

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin

    $ mkdir -p ~/android/system

Now we'll need repo. Let's download it and make it executable:

    $ curl http://android.git.kernel.org/repo > ~/bin/repo
    
    $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Log out and back in so the changes take effect.

Now initialized the repository and pull the source (with my repos attached):

    $ cd ~/android/system/
    
    $ repo init -u git://github.com/playfulgod/android.git -b gingerbread
    
    $ repo sync -j16

Depending on your connection, this might take awhile.

Extract necessary binaries and proprietary files
------------------------------------------------

We will need to reuse some proprietary files. The best ROM to obtain these from is a build of CM7-Ascend (05012011 or later). The Tapout ROM can also be used:

    $ cd
    
    $ cd ~/android/system/device/huawei/ascend/
    
    $ ./extract-files.sh

Building CM7
-------------
Once thats done you can start compiling.

Follow the aosp instructions on setting up the build environment. - http://source.android.com/source/download.html

When the environment is setup, we need to grab a copy of Koush's ROM Manager. This is necessary to build CM7.

    $ cd
    
    $ ~/android/system/vendor/cyanogen/get-rommanager

Now, we build:

    $ cd ~/android/system
    
    $ . build/envsetup.sh && brunch ascend

Installing CM7
---------------
If the build was successful, you can now take the update zip found in out/target/product/ascend/ and flash using a custom recovery. Make sure to grab the latest Gapps to complete the experience.
